    <hr>
    <p>This is my first coding experience using css and html. This tutorial is about making paragraph, styling, coloring, alignment</p>
    <h2 class="header2">Paragraphs & Topic Sentences</h2>
    <p>A paragraph is a series of sentences that are organized and coherent, and are all related to a single topic. 
       <br> Almost every piece of writing you do that is longer than a few sentences should be organized into paragraphs. 
      <br> This is because paragraphs show a reader where the subdivisions of an essay begin and end, and thus help <br> the reader see the organization of the essay and grasp its main points.</p>
