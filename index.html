    <h2 class="header2">Paragraphs & Topic Sentences</h2>
    <p>A paragraph is a series of sentences that are organized and coherent, and are all related to a single topic. 
       <br> <i> Almost every piece of writing </i> you do that is <em> longer than a few sentences </em> should be organized into paragraphs. 
      <br> This is because paragraphs show a reader where the subdivisions of an essay begin and end, and thus help <br> the reader see the organization of the essay and grasp its main points.</p>
